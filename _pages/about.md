I am a Chilean community ecologist. I earned my PhD at Rutgers University (USA) and I currently am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Jyväskylä (Finland).

My research interests lie in the intersection between experiments and theory. I am particularly interested in the effects of spatial configurations in metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics.
