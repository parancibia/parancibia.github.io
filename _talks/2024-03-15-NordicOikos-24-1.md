**Abstract**
Drivers behind community ecology are complex and thus difficult to fully understand. Though observational data on patterns is ample, experimental data lags since the cost of experiments restricts their scale of inquiry and/or level of replication.

Technological advances allow using robotics to run high-throughput experiments (HTE) with low manual effort, as well as automating pipelines to process data without major human effort. Despite this promise we show that automated HTE are rare in community ecology, even if some automated methods are part of a study. We discuss the potential, bottlenecks and limitations of using automated HTE in
community ecology, and as proof of concept, we present a case study with protists where we show the feasibility of running HTE coupling robotic microscopy and machine-learning. Albeit HTE are rarely used in community ecology, they present great potential, still their use requires effort and the methods cannot be directly generalized among study systems.
