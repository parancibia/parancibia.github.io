**Abstract**\
Drivers behind community ecology are complex and thus difficult to fully understand. Though observational data describing ecological patterns is ample, experimental data lags behind since the high cost of experiments restricts their scale of inquiry and/or level of replication.
Current technological advances allow using robotics to run high-throughput experiments (HTE) with low manual effort, as well as automating pipelines to process data without major human effort. Despite this promise we show that automated HTE are still rare in community ecology, even if some automated methods are part of a study. We present a case study with aquatic protists where we showthe feasibility of running HTE coupling robotic microscopy and machine-learning to count and identify species. Albeit HTE are rarely used in community ecology, they present great potential, stilltheir use requires effort and the methods cannot be directly generalized among study systems.
