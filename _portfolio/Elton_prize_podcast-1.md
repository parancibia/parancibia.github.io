I was invited to the podcast as one of the shorlisted candidates for the Elton prize, awarded to the best paper by an early career researcher published at the Journal of Animal Ecology in 2022. In this <a href='https://open.spotify.com/episode/4B8WVMHMBMzsuCspiJI6g8?si=ATT9MnHdSf6y07XFWmTBtw'> episode</a> we talked about the paper <a href='https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1365-2656.13647'> *Network topology and patch connectivity affect dynamics in experimental and model metapopulations*</a>, among other things (in English).

You can also read a blogpost about this paper in the  <a href='https://animalecologyinfocus.com/2022/01/04/connections-matter-how-patterns-of-habitat-connectivity-affect-population-dynamics/' > Animal in Focus</a> blog.
